# This script is designed to suspend the VMware Fusion VM's running on this machine, 
# execute a script (passed to this script as the first argument) and then resume the
# VMware Fusion VM's which were suspended during the first phase of this script.
#
# Note : This script will not check if the VM's on this system are successfully suspended or restarted. 
#        If such checks are required then the use of a separate system is recommended.
#        This script is primarily designed to provide an interface to simplify the manipulation of VM's in a 
#        suspended state as wright forward as possible.
