Currently there is a single set of scripts dedicated to suspending and starting virtual machines. One of the scripts available will suspend all running virtual machines on the system, execute a script of your choice and then resume all the virtual machines which were initially suspended.

If you have any handy VMWare fusion scripts, then fork the project add your scripts and then put in a pull request.
